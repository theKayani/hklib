# hklib

This is a collection of useful classes and functionalities that I found myself in need of over my years as a developer.

##### Version: 1.0.7

## Usage

#### Reference
You can access the Javadoc over at https://javadoc.io/doc/com.thekayani/hklib

The process to use it is very simple and are similar to each other.
Add the repository, and add the library/dependency

### Maven
Add `hklib` dependency

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.thekayani</groupId>
        <artifactId>hklib</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.7</version>
    </dependency>

### Gradle
Add `hklib` dependency

    dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.thekayani:hklib:1.0.7'
	}

### Flat `jar` File
You have access to the `jar` file with the compiled code and sources under GitHub releases.
You can download the `jar` file [here](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.thekayani/hklib).
This can be used directly on the command line when executing a Java program using
the `-classpath` flag with the `java` command. Or added into your own project in various
IDEs.

#### Others
You can explore the other ways over at https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.thekayani/hklib

## Development

To develop this library further, you can clone the repo and use Maven to
import this project into the major Java IDEs such as Eclipse, Netbeans, and IntelliJ IDEA
