# hklib
This is a collection of useful classes and functionalities that I found myself in need of over my years as a developer.

## Development

To develop this library further, I suggest using Eclipse: `File -> Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace -> Select Archive File`

Then point to the `zip` file that you can download using the green button above.

Once complete, you should be able to run the `Main.java` in the `com.hk` package.

I plan on adding tests and comments to everything, but it is a process... :D
